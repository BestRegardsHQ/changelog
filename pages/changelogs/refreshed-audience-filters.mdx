This week we rolled out a new UI for audience filters that is more accessible and more powerful.

Gone are the days of the input fields not focusing correctly and not being able to select multiple values at the same time.

As part of this work audience filters are now consistent across the whole product.

We've also spent some time optimising the queries they generate and got a good speed bump when loading charts that use many filters.

**Other improvements**

- Fix an issue with the CMD-K search causing "No result found" to show up even when there are some results on screen
- We built a new reverse trial experience giving new signups a 14 day trial of all of our features
- Fixed a bug causing the search counts not to be correct in the people page
