This week we're launching the most requested upgrade to our audience filters: **combining AND/OR logic**. This means you can now combine multiple filters to create more complex segments of users.

The most obvious use-case that we've been always wanting to support is:

This is now possible with June.

Building this was a challenging engineering task, because the audience rules are used across the product in many different places. We had to make sure that the new logic works everywhere, and that it doesn't break any existing segments.

With this release you can now use combined filters in:

- Reports
- User and company search
- Slack alerts

This is another great milestone on our journey to add more and more flexibility into June.

## Our first G2 badge

We're excited to announce that we've been awarded our first G2 badge! We're now a **High Performer** in the **Product Analytics** category.

That's a great achievement for us, and we're very thankful to all our customers who have left us a review on G2. We're looking forward to keep improving our product every week, and make more and more customers happy.

**Other improvements**

- We're iterating and improving the editable home features we shipped last week. This week we've made a couple of improvements like a first iteration of allowing you to create multiple views, polishing the UI, adding a visble time-range for each card and added re-ordering of cards
- We fixed a bug where "Any event" filters weren't including page events when users selected events as "non-active"

  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
