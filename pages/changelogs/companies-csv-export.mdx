The way we're building June is very incremental. Often we try out a feature in a small part of the product to see what happens.

When we see that some of these features resonate we then work towards consistency and make them work across the product.

Some examples of features that started like this are:

- Being able to click on any chart
- The common sense insight cards that show some outlier users in reports (the most engaged users card for example)
- And from this week CSV exports

Kudos to our friends at Requestly for both requesting this feature and for trying it out once we had a first version.


**Other improvements**

- Add crm sync settings frequency
- Fix HubSpot rate limiting issues for apps with more than 20.000 syncs a day
- Fix power users week on week not getting re-computed correctly
- Fix most visited pages to be consistent in the UI
- Improved the performance of the report page
- Improved email layout for CSV exports
