This week the pace on the team has been unreal.

Over 65 updates have been shipped in this week alone. Which is remarkable as we're still a very small team.

As part of this changelog I wanted to highlight and thank the incredible customers that pushed us in the right direction providing great feedback for us to work on.

This week's updates were brought you by:

- Lukas and Sanjeev from [Causal](https://causal.app)
- Alexander from Multi [Multi](https://multi.app)
- Zev from [Attio](https://attio.com)
- Dennis from [Amie](https://amie.so)
- John from [Depict](https://depict.ai/)
- Benedict from [Arrows](https://arrows.to)

Thank you for your feedback, and can't appreciate enough your patience and understanding as we work through some of these issues.

We're far from perfect, but we're working hard to get there.

## How can I remove this Slack alert?

The first big update of the week we're really excited about is our new Slack Alerts Hub.

We completely overhauled our Slack settings page so that you now can manage all your Slack alerts in one place.

We've received a ton of feedback over the years about this, so we decided to fix this once and for all.

Here's the new Slack updates hub:

You can both see all your enabled notifications and edit them right from this page.

## Slack getting too noisy?

**"My engineering team loves Slack notifications for new features, it really gives us the pulse of our product, but after some time they get too noisy and we need to disable them manually" - Alexander from Multi**

If you've been using our instant Slack notifications you know that sometimes you can become a victim of your own success.

Wouldn't it be delightful if we pro-actively helped you make these notifications more discreet?

We shipped just that! Now once things get too noisy in a Slack channel we'll show you a quick menu that will allow you to manage these notifications.

You can see the new menu in action here:

## CMD-K has been slow for me

What's the point of having a quick search if it isn't quick?

Well Zev from Attio founnd that our search was too slow. So we fixed it.

We pushed 5 different performance improvements to how we allow you to search users, companies and worskpaces 6 times faster.

From our [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io/) dashboards 90% of searches (the P90) take less than 58ms. Our P99 is now 2 seconds, we'll push an additional improvement this week that should help us become even faster here!

## The audience filters are janky

Dennis just had a [huge launch]() and was trying to collect some 1:1 feedback from customers.

He found the audience filters to be janky and texted me about it.

So last week we rebuilt their UI from scratch and made them much more intuitive to use, both in Reports and in the People list.

You should now be able to add the right audience filter with half the clicks.

## John was confused by our Retention insights

John recently started sending data to June. One of the things that he was frustrated with was that even if their product is doing great, somehow June was showing 0% retention.

This was because he signed up less than 12 weeks ago, so we didn't have the data yet to show the correct retention number.

But is it really acceptable to wait 12 weeks to be able to see the right retention number showing up in the home cards? He didn't think so, and we agree with him.

So this week we shipped a smart logic to show you an in-progress retention highlight number if you haven't been sending events for enough time.

## Workspace level reports not loading with complex filters

Benedict from Arrows was struggling with a workspace level report not loading correctly.

Turns out the audience rules for their report were a bit too much for our database to handle.

We quickly pushed some performance optimisations to the queries and it now loads in seconds!

When building a complex data product like ours you can never know how the data people will send you will look like. So it's essential for us to fine tune the way we retrieve data based on real world scenarios.

If you face similar issues, let us know and we'll try and fix the problem as fast as we can.
