The hardest challenge when building a product like June is finding the right balance between simplicity and the ability to make complex calculations.

In the past couple of years we've been a little shy in tackling this, and used our focus to build a unique set of reports and building a very advanced audience filtering logic that allows nesting rules and combining all sorts of filters.

A couple weeks ago, we spent some time designing the feature of reports in June and got really excited by all the possibilities.

Last week, starting from our most flexible reports we started rolling out a new UI to create and edit reports.

Here was the main thing we wanted to achieve with this redesign.

Creating a report today in June takes at least 8 clicks:

- From any screen in the product you can click "New report" (1 click)
- You can then see a modal with different options (1-3 clicks)
- You can then preview each of these reports (1 click)
- You can then pick to create one of these reports (1 click)
- You can now set up this report selecting events and audiences (3-4 clicks)
- Finally the "Create report" button shows you a chart (1 click)

When I wrote this out I felt embarassed, but hey, the first step towards improving yourself is recognising your biggest flaws...

We've now rethought the experience starting with one constraint "How do we make creating a new report something that can be done in 1 click?".

It turns out it's totally doable, and we're working towards this!

The first step has been to make the step to preview and setup part happen after you land on a report.

The good news, is that it's live today. You can try this out on our Funnel and Explorer reports. Try to add and remove steps and see data reload **instantly**.

In the coming weeks, we'll be ironing out the details and rolling out these updates to all reports.

**Other improvements**

- You can now search for events in the event feed for a single user
- Do not camelize properties and context objects in the developer tools section
- We added a tab in the Attio CRM settings to highlight any syncing errors (coming soon to Hubspot)
- We updated the feed copy to use the object names
- Fixed a bug with how pageviews are displayed in the drilldown on the user activity chart
- We improved the CMD-K behavior for searching reports and scrlling through many values
- We fixed the recommended filters empty state in the report setup
- Improved the CRM syncs behavior when objects get updated, but none of the updated fields are being synced (we now skip syncing them)
- We built a new weekly email digest that we've been trailing internally, if you'd like to try it out for your workspace, come say Hi! and let us know in the chat
