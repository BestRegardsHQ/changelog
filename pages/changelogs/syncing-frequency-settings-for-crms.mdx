This week we've released more improvements to our CRM sync capabilities.

You can now select the update frequency for your Attio and Hubspot integrations, so you can control your API usage.

Additionally you can now sync our new auto-generated companies object with both our Attio and Hubspot integrations.

In the coming weeks we want to keep building on these improvements to make this the best possible experience.

**Other improvements**

- Show if guardrail is being used or not on billing page when surpassing event limits
- We now compute traits on update and create so that you don't need to wait for a day to see your computed traits

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
