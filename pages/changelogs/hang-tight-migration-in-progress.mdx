We've been making progress on our transition to our new data-model that will give all of you company analytics without any set up.

This week's milestone was being able to have most reports and our audience filters work with automatically generated companies.

We think over the next week we should be able to wrap up the first iteration of all this work and release this feature to a first batch of customers.

Overall we think it will take around a month to polish and release to all this new data-model. It's been a tough call to focus on this, but we think it's the right call.

As always fixing critical bugs and improving the overall product quality is our number one priority - so if you spot anything that we should fix, let us know.

**Other improvements**

- There's a new logo uploader in the settings which is more polished than what we had before
- We now use our automatic enrichment to set the logos for new workspaces automatically
- We pushed some improvements based on feedback to our Hubspot syncs
