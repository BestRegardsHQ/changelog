Starting today, you can finally stop pretending to remember that random string of letters, numbers, and hieroglyphics you created months ago. That's right! You can now trigger a Forgot Password flow, making it easier than ever to reset your password when your brain decides to take an unscheduled vacation. 🧠🌴

### How It Works:

**Step 1**: Admit you forgot your password. It’s the first step to recovery, and we've all been there. Simply click “Forgot Password.”

**Step 2**: We’ll send you an email. If you don’t get it within a minute, don't panic. Check your spam folder—because nothing says "security" like hiding important emails in the junk pile next to your 30% off coupons.

**Step 3**: Click the link in the email, and voilà! You’ll be whisked away to a magical land where you can create a brand-new password. (Pro tip: this time, maybe avoid "password123" & remember to use a password manager).
