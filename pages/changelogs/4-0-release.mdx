This week we're extremely proud to announce our public launch of June 4.0

Our CEO Enzo recorded a video for the occasion and wrote a blog post that you can find [here](https://www.june.so/blog/june-4-0).

This release is the culmination of a year and a half of weekly releases.

**Other improvements**

- We pushed some fixes to the onboarding experience to make sure it's as smooth as we can make it be
- Bug fixes and improvements to our real-time first and last seen computed traits
