We've received some great feedback since we started sending out a weekly digest for June a couple of weeks ago.

Given many of you asked asked to be able to customise the digest, this week we introduced a setting to customise your weekly digest.

You can now pick the report we'll use to generate the digest and can disable individual insights if they're not relevant to you.

**Other improvements**

- We now show an error in the developer tools if track calls have the groupId in the event properties instead of the context
- Change the report name of power people to power users
- Export anonymous_id as part of our data export
- Fix how quotes get applied across the product
- Make required mappings destination not editable
- Fix Attio sync when the domain of a company is present, but isn't valid

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
<MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
{children}
</MdxLayout>
);
