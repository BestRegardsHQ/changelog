This week we've been working on two main things: trait pinning on profiles and the new Pro plan.

## Trait pinning on profiles

Much like in any CRM, you can now pin your most important traits to the top of your profiles. This is a great way to highlight the most important information about your users and customers.

Additionally because a lot of trait values were being cut off unnecessarily we've updated the design to show more of the trait value.

## New Pro plan

We've been working on a new Pro plan that will be available soon. This week we've built the foundation to allow us to offer a new plan with more features and more flexibility.

You can now upgrade to the Pro plan from the billing page and get access to our new CRM features and more.

**Other improvements**

- We pushed fixes to CSV exports of companies in the Active Users and New Users reports.

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
