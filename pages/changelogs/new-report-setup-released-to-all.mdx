The big release for this week is our new report setup. It's now available across all reports.

With this new design we hope to make it much easier to discover that reports can be customised.

We've spent the past 3 years adding more and more flexibility to June, but the truth is that 90% of the time most people engage with just what's on the surface of the product.

It's extremely important for us to keep simplifying the experience and make sure that over time as June grows up, it also becomes more approachable and easy to use.

This is a tough challenge, but with this new report setup redesign, we think we're moving in the right direction.

Let us know what you think of it!
