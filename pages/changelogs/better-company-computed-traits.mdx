Around half of our customers have products where their end-users cannot belong to more than one workspace.

For this reason in most of our product we support not specifying the "groupId" in every event to track usage within workspaces.

Four our computed traits capabilities this wasn't the case - so until now, computed traits for workspaces have only been available for companies that send the "groupId" as part of their events.

This week we upgraded our capabilities to support computed traits for workspaces that don't send the group context.

This is a huge upgrade in terms of making one of June's most magical capabilities available to all of our customers.

We hope you're excited as we are about this.

**Other improvements**

- We now filter out unix epoch timestamps for first seen (as some cusrtomers were seeing first seen in the 1970s for some users when sending invalid timestamps for events)
- We reversed insight title and description in views, making your report titles more promintent
- We fixed as security vulnerability with one of our web app endpoints
- We improved the CRM sync ease of setup, by adding a button to manually run a sync from the UI, which should make it faster to get set up when starting from scratch
