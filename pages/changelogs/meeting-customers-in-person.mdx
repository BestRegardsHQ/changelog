In the last couple of years we've been able to grow our customer base across the globe. We have customers in the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We've been able to do this without ever meeting most of our customers in person.

But we've been missing something. We've been missing the human connection. We've been missing the ability to see our customers in person and to talk to them face to face.

Being able to get to know people a bit more, learn their day to day challenges, and see how they use our product is invaluable. It's something that we've been missing.

For the month of July, myself and Alberto are traveling to New York and San Francisco to meet with customers.

What we're hoping to get out of these meetings is a better understanding of how our customers use our product, what their day to day challenges are, what they like about our product, and what they don't like about our product.

We're also hoping to get a better understanding of how we can improve our product and how we can make it better for you.

## The biggest areas for improvement

What we think are the biggest areas of improvement for June are:

- **Improving the overall performance of the app** - A couple of weeks ago we started investing into improving loading times, and we've seen some good improvements. We're going to continue to invest in this area and expect to see 5-10x improvements in the coming months.
- **Making customisation and complex analysis possible** - While using June it's easy to get started with simple analysis, but it's hard to do more complex analysis. We're going to be investing in making more complex analysis possible.
- **Double down on presence, making analytics useful in your day to day** - We're going to be doubling down on our strengths. We can go a lot deeper in the areas that we're already strong in. Think our company pages, our Slack integration and our opinionated approach to analysis. There's a lot more we can do here.

We think that overall there's never been as clear of a path for us to grow as there is now. We're excited to see what the next couple of months bring and are very excited to be able to grow our team to help us get there.

## Small wins from last week

Of course, we've been also building product and fixing bugs. Here are some of the small wins from last week:

- The most triggered events on the profile pages now exclude events that are not triggered by users.
- We fixed an error that was preventing a minority of users to uninstall the Slack integration (when the Slack integration was installed by a user that had an inactive account).
- We added some examples to our docs of how to use our Ruby SDK in test mode
- We fixed a bug with the feature report preview that was causing an ugly layout for the first cards
- We added a loading state to our workspace list
- We added documentation for implementing June using our HTTP API

In the meantime, our biggest focus was on identifying the root cause of some of our performance issues. We've been able to identify a couple of problems and have been working on fixing them. We're hoping to see some good improvements in the coming weeks.
