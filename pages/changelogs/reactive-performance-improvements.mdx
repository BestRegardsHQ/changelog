This week we were planning to release our new objects for automatically generating companies, but reality slapped us in the face ğŸ¥¹

As you know product development is not a science and as much as we can all try to set deadlines, sometimes things go wrong along the way.

On Tuesday, we started getting alerts and many customers reached out because of some bugs and performance issues. So as a team we decided to pause all work and be all hands on deck to fix as many issues as we could.

As part of last week, we pushed almost twenty different performance improvements, some adding more pre-computation to reduce loading times, others making our frontend more performant and others giving more resources to our servers.

Overall we should now be in a much healthier state, we'll keep working on improvements across the board to make the experience of using June as delightful as possible.

**Other improvements**

- We changed the people list pagination to not be sorted by last seen, it's 10x faster now
- Fixed the header UI when the workspace name is very long
- Fixes online state on user profile
- Fix many visible console errors
- Support for adding columns to company lists
- We're experimenting with AI activity summaries, reach out to us to learn more
- We now use breadcrumbs for navigation in all the sections of the product
- Fixed a UI overflow bug with the report level toggle
