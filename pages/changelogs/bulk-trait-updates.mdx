One of the principles we have when building June is make sure that everything you see in the UI can be edited.

We think the ability to control what you see and update things is the foundation of being able to trust in your data.

It's also pretty magical to be able to quickly create cohorts of users based on specific traits to then be able to run some fast analysis.

So this week with this in mind, we're super happy to release the ability to add traits in bulk to your Workspaces and Companies from the People list.

To try it out, you can head to the `/people` section, add some filtering rules and apply traits to those users.


**Other improvements**

- We moved the group context setting to the Workspaces object settings
- Improved the experience of remapping fields in the Attio integration. We now highlight more clearly the required fields when setting things up, and allow editing the data mapping source
- Fixed an issue with Mixpanel imports taking too long to run
- Fixed an issue when updating the order of steps in the funnel report
- Fixed an issue with computed traits not getting applied with the correct timestamps
- We polished the UI of the onboarding accordion, especially on smaller screens
- Fixed the experience of adding traits to reflect the object name
