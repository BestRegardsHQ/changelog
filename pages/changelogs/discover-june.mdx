It's been a couple of years since we started building June and a lot has changed since we started.

This week was full of updates and changes. One realisation I had was that everything we did this week would've not made much sense two years ago.

One big thing that happened last week was that we launched our new landing page.

It took us 3-4 months from start to finish to ship this new landing page.

Usually we're super scrappy and iterative when launching new things, but we've now reached the point that we understand pretty well who we are and what we stand for. It now makes sense to invest a bunch of time and money in saying it well.

This meant finding our own brand voice, coming up with a good design language and building some delightful animations showcasing the product.

The second big release is the new **Discover page**.

In July of last year we launched views as a replacement to our product home.

They're basically dashboards as you can customise them and add whatever charts you want.

But June is a lot more than reports, and we've been doing onboarding calls for 3 years now helping people discover everything the product does.

So this week we took the learnings from hundreds of onboarding calls and built the Discover page.

We hope it will help you find all the ways June can help you to connect your team with your product.

To check it our just open the product and it should be there - in the main sidebar.

The third thing we worked on is polishing the product and fixing small papercuts here and there.

Frankly, we have a long way to go to really nail the basics, but the whole team is now 100% focused on our overall product quality and performance.

You can expect the product to progressively level up in the next couple of months.

If you do notice anything that's not working properly, or that looks off, please let me know and we'll fix it as soon as we can.

You can email me any bug at ferruccio@june.so and I'll make sure it gets fixed as soon as possible.

**Other improvements**

- In the Slack integration settings you can now have an overview of all enabled notifications. This way you can quickly disable the ones that become too noisy.
- Fixes to the company performed event filter in audiences
- Optimise the CMD-K search to only look for enabled objects
- We just launched [a new landing page](https://june.so) - it took us months of iterations to design and build! Check it out
- Fixed a bug when using the exactly/less than event audience filters
