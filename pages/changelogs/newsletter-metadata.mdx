Hold onto your hats, because our latest update is all about making your newsletters shine brighter than a diamond in a disco ball! Say hello to Metadata Support for Newsletters!

Want to see how your newsletter will look when it hits the web? The new SearchPreview component lets you preview it in all its glory—no surprises here, just pure brilliance.

And with the SocialCard component, you can ensure your newsletter looks fabulous when shared, because let’s face it, even pixels deserve a makeover. 💅

### Improvements?

Oh, we've got those too! Enjoy buttery-smooth animations while editing your metadata, and keep an eye on those character counts so your titles and descriptions don’t end up with the dreaded "…" cut-off. We’ve also added a friendly file size check for social card images, because nothing ruins your social media game like an oversized image that refuses to play nice.

### Bug Fixes

In the Bug Fixes department, we’ve squashed that pesky issue where uploading large files would crash the app. Now, instead of a meltdown, you’ll get a gentle nudge to resize. Consider it your app’s way of saying, "Maybe let’s keep it light, okay?"

And that's it for today's update! We're always working on making Best Regards better, so be sure to check out the rest of the changelog for more details on what's new.

Happy emailing! 🚀
