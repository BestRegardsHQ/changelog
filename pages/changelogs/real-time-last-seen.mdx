The last seen and first seen computed traits are now live âœ¨

Up until now these numbers updated every 24 hours, making it hard to filter out users that have started using the product recently.

So last week we've completely revamped our computed traits for first and last seen to be recomputed live.

As small and simple as it sounds this was a big engineering undertaking, as we're actively monitoring millions of users.

Additionally as part of our continued work on making audiences more and more useful we now show audiences on the user profiles.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed the edit button alignment on the product home
- We now show when computed traits are read-only
- The report type switcher is now disabled when an insight from the report is pinned in a view
- Fixed an error that prevented reports from loading on some workspaces
- We now export the event type as part of data exports


export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
