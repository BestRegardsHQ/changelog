This week's biggest update is a live update state for our CRM syncs.

Up until now the way we've shown progress for data getting synced over to CRMs has not been live.

For large workspaces and especially for the first time around syncing data with a CRM though things could take a long time, and waiting times to get all the data synced over weren't straightforward to understand.

For this reason this week we've decided to make things better by showing a live state for CRM syncs.

This means you can now see how far along we are in syncing over all your users or companies into your favorite CRM.

Additionally we've now further integrated Attio within our product. From now on you can get deeplinks into your Attio objects directly from user and company pages.

This brings the Attio and Hubspot integrations to the same level of depth.

**Other improvements**

- Standardise the labels for weekly periods in the "New signups" report
- We pushed some fixes to our hamburger menu on the mobile homepage, and other small things like our meta description
- We added a banner in the product after onboardign to recommend booking a call with us
- Fix an error with computed traits showing "1970" as the first seen date
- Avoid re-rendering the table when changing the order on the People list
