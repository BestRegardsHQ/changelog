Last week we were on a company retreat discussing the biggest opportunities for us. By looking at the data and collecting feedback from some customer interviews, we realized that we could greatly improve our onboarding experience.

We decided to focus on the first 5 minutes of a new user's experience. We wanted to make sure that they would be able to get value from June as quickly as possible.

We started by manually going through the onboarding flow and looking for any friction points. We found a ton of them - and set out to fix them.

One of the biggest issues on our list was the delay from sending events to seeing them in the product. For looking at metrics, this was not a big deal. But for debugging, it was a huge pain.

So this week, we focused on making debugging instant. You can now send an event from your development environment and see it in June within a second.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed a bug with pinned traits not showing when they have no value.
- Fixed our Bubble plugin for server-side events.
- Fixed the behaviour of our events list when users delete some events.
- Fixed a bug with the Slack integration for the New Users report.
- Design polish and improvements to our CMD+K search.
- Fixed the user feed showing an error message when loading more events in some cases.
