Deciding what to build as a product team in the early stage is a balancing act.

To deliver more value to customers you need to make sure both that what you already have is working well and that you are building the right things.

This week, while most of our team was focused on shipping performance improvements across the board, we also shipped some new features to address some of the problems people mentioned in our feedback sessions.

## New events page

Our events page was starting to show its age. In our feedback sessions we collected a lot of feedback about it, and we decided to build a new version of it.

First we sat down to identify the criteria we should use to evaluate different designs for the page. We came up with the following:

- Be able to see all the properties of the events without having to hover over them
- Be able to navigate the page even when there are a lot of different properties for an event
- Be able to see the property values of the events in the past week and month, not just the all-time value

We then went ahead and designed a new version of the page that we thought would address these problems and shipped it.

We are still collecting feedback on the new page, but so far it seems to be a big improvement over the old one.

## Event breakdowns in the explorer and feature audit

One of the other gaps we identified was that it was hard to see the breakdown of events by their properties in the explorer and feature audit.

If you had an event with 10 different property values to analyse, you would have to set up 10 different filters manually to see the breakdown.

While working on this we realised that there were a lot more edge cases to consider than we initially thought. For example, what if you change the name of a property value for an event to keep things consistent? Can you still create a visualisation that is easy to understand?

Figuring out the right design for this was taking a lot of time and it felt weren't getting to a 10x better solution. So we decided to ship a first version of it that would allow us to just solve the usability problem.

Not over-thinking allowed us to ship some value faster. With time we'll get a better understanding of the gaps in our solution and we'll be able to iterate on it.

## Performance improvements

On top of these new features we've also worked very hard on improving the performance of the app. We've made a lot of progress on this front:

- We increased the speed of all queries by 30% by optimising the machines that run our database
- We improved how we compute funnels. Load times for funnels should now be up to 10x faster
- We improved how the feature report is computed. Load times for the feature report should now be up to 10x faster.
- We tweaked some of our caching strategies and now over 80% of the requests we serve are pre-computed and served from cache

We are not done yet, there's lots more we need to do to make the app fast and reliable. But we are making good progress.

## Other improvements

- We added an option to opt-out of the AI features in the settings page
- The explorer report is now a widget that everybody can use
- We enabled the ability to create multiple views for everyone
