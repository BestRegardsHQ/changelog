This week we had a team retreat in Orvieto, Italy. We spent a few days together to zoom-out and set a direction for the coming months.

We also had a lot of fun and ate a lot of good food.

The main outcome of the retreat is that we'll be focusing on making getting started with June easier. We'll be working on a new onboarding flow, a new website, and making the product more intuitive.

As a remote team, we don't get to spend a lot of time together. It was great to be able to spend time together and get to know each other better.
