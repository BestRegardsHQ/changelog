Today we're introducing some major improvements to our date filtering capabilities. As our main focus right now is making June more flexible we're trying to focus on building some easy to understand building blocks that we can then compose together to create more complex workflows.

As part of this work we're introducing two new capabilities as part of our users and company filtering capabilities.

## Between dates event filtering

Many users asked us to build this to support cohort analysis across every report. By using this filter you can now filter all your reports with filters like "Signed up between 1st of May and 1st of June".

## Date filtering support in traits

As a rapid follow up to the first release, we also got requests for filtering traits by date. This means that if you have a date trait like "Created at" on your users you can now filter your users by that date within reports, Slack notifications or in the people list.

## Other improvements

Last week we released the June AI dock to all customers on the Growth plan. As part of that we introduced an additional opt-in for users for users to enable the feature as it uses OpenAI's GPT-4 under the hood. Once approved we send an email to all users in the workspace.

While doing this work we identified some tech debt in how we built our Demo workspaces. Because of the way they were built there was the potential for our engineers to add code that could send an email to all June users.

While this never happened - we decided to eliminate the risk of it ever happening. We updated this part of the codebase putting safeguards that make sure this can never happen. Nothing changes for you users, but we're happy to have prioritized this work.

## What's next?

We're starting to work on two long requested major updates to both our filtering capabilities and to our product home.

More on this in the coming weeks!
