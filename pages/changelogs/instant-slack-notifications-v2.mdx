One of the first things you get after signing up for June is configurable Slack notifications for any of your events.

This week we are releasing a major update to the feature with a new UI and a much more powerful configuration.

The improvements we're shipping today have been requested for almost a year, so we're really excited to finally get them out.

**Multiple Slack notifications per event**

You can now configure multiple Slack notifications for each event. This in combination with the property based filtering and audiences for notifications allows different teams to receive different notifications for the same event.

This means that if your sales team wants to receive a notification when an account that is over their usage quota opens the product and your product team wants to measure the usage of a specific feature, you can now configure both notifications for the same event.

**Company traits in notifications**

If you're sending the company as part of your events, you can now use company traits in your notifications. This means you can include details such as the company name, size or plan in your notifications. This is especially useful if you're sending notifications for sales use cases.

**Other improvements**

We're iterating on our AI features and we're getting ready for a major update for our paying customers. Last week's milestone was internal testing for the new interface and user experience. Next week we're getting ready for a public release.

We'll also share technical details about our implementation so you can learn about our approach to putting AI assisted features in the hands of our users.
