Today's the day - we just enabled for all users the new Companies. Just in time for the new year.


If you've been following us closely in the past two months we've been rewriting almost every touchpoint of the product to support tracking a new kinds of object, companies.

After integrating with CRMs we learned that for B2B businesses a lot of the time tracking the domain of a company in analytics provides 90% of the value with no engineering effort.

So what we decided to do is to rename our existing "companies" to "workspaces" in June to support any sort of group tracking you need.

And to additionally automatically generate a new Companies object based on the email domain of your users.

So if you didn't have access to tracking companies until now, you can now head to the [Objects page](https://analytics.june.so/redirect-to-my-workspace/settings/objects) in our setting and enable Companies.

If you're wondering whether this new feature is useful for you - here's an article explaining [everything that you need to know](https://help.june.so/en/articles/8731155-should-you-use-auto-generated-companies) about this new feature.
