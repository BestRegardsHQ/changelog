We're a hiring for 3 roles and growing our team from 6 to 9!

To go fast sometimes you need to go a little slower first to be then able to accelerate.

This week we spent some time together as a team, planning the next three months and interviewing potential future teammates.

We can't wait to have a couple of new talented teammates joining us so that we can keep building a better service for you.

If you'd like to join a tight knit remote team building a delightful product here are our open roles:

- [Product engineers #3 and #4](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/june/jobs/SHd7fFLYG-product-engineer-3)
- [First GTM hire](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/june/jobs/jJWtHfl-go-to-market-hire-1)
