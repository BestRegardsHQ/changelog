One thing we think product analytics tool should learn from CRMs is data modeling.

This week, we just released our first step into making June more flexible and adaptable to your unique needs.

If you head into the Settings section in the product, you can now find the Objects tab.

## What does this mean for you?

Over the next weeks, we're going to release some powerful settings that will allow you to customise the groups June can handle for you.

This release will be also accompanied by our new automatically generated company profiles, which will be automatically created using the domain of the email of your users.

This means that with a basic June setup, you'll know get company tracking without doing any work.

Additionally you'll be able to rename any existing "groups" you created. This means you'll now be able to have Companies, alongside "Workspaces" or "Instances" or whatever you prefer.

## Behind the scenes

We're now almost one month into this project of making June much easier to set up and we're finally wrapping things up and getting ready for release.

In order to build this we had to update individually all of our Reports, our People section, our documentation, Smart traits and our CRM integrations.

We also had to change the way we work for a month and stop being as iterative as we usually are as we think it would've been highly confusing to release these changes gradually.



**Other improvements**

- Fixed a bug on user and company profiles that prevented seeing the value of traits if they're objects
- Fixed a bug that prevented you to type in Intercom when the side panel is open (in drilldowns, setting up slack and in the report setup)
- You can now save audiences without a description
- Fixed a bug in funnel breakdowns when many labels are displayed
- Fixed some issues with the report setup that made the event picker transparent
