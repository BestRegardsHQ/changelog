In this week's update we're introducing some major improvements to how our funnels work.

In the past when clicking into one of your funnel reports it wasn't possible to see which users belonged to each bucket.

This made it hard to understand what was going on and to take action.

So what we've done is add a new section to the funnel drilldown page that shows you the users that belong to each bucket.

So if you're looking at your signup activation funnel and have a user trait called `role` you can now see which users converted by role.

## Other improvements

- We pushed some reliability improvements to how we import data from Amplitude and Mixpanel. This should make the process more reliable and faster

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
