This week we took cues from the ways we've seen people interacting with our AI powered insights and finished rebuilding the experience of AI assisted product analytics.

The improvements we made are the following:

1. We built an accuracy rating system that will allow us to keep track of the quality of our AI powered insights. This will allow us to improve the quality of our insights over time.

2. We built a new interface for our AI powered insights that will allow you to easily ask deeper questions about your data.

3. We gave our conversational AI knowledge about the report it belongs to, so that it can answer deeper questions about the report you are looking at. For example, in a feature report, you can ask the AI to show you the users who used the feature the most in the first week after they signed up.

We also re-organised the settings of reports into a new floating dock.

This new interface is designed to make sure:

1. That the settings are always visible and accessible
2. That you can easily ask deeper questions about your data
3. That you can easily share your insights with your team
4. That you can always switch between user and company level insights

## Sharing the behind the scenes of our AI powered insights

We've been working with LLMs like GPT-4 by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic and as we think most companies will be integrating these technologies into their products in the next few years, we thought it would be interesting to share the behind the scenes of our AI powered insights.

Is there any question you'd want us to answer? Let us know.
