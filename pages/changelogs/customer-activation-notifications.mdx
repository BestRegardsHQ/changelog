One of the most important behaviours that makes teams know how their customers behave is having live pulse of what's happening.

As a rule of thumb for relevance, your whole team should be looking forward to receive these live updates. Some of the things we love to celebrate at June are:

- Someone just started sending product data
- Someone just opened reports for the 10th time
- Someone just created their first report
- Someone just upgraded to a paid plan

This week we released a major improvement to our instant notifications, by releasing thresholds.

Thresholds allow you to receive notifications like:

- "Christina @ Vanta just created her first project
- "Eoghan @ Intercom just opened his 10th report - he's activated"

To enable these notifications head to the Events page and click on "Setup Slack alert".

Connect Slack and craft a message that your team will look forward to see every day.

**Other improvements**

- Fixed an issue with long event names getting truncated in the report setup
- Fixed an issue with CSV exports for the Funnel report
