Sometimes to work on the most important things, we need to take a step back and make sure we are building on solid foundations. In the last few weeks, and for the next few weeks, we are working on fixing the single most painful part of June: tracking companies.

What we realised is that it's too hard to set things up correctly to track how companies are using your product. We want everyone to be able to do it, and we want it to be magical.

Now in beta, slowly rolling out to everyone, we are introducing an automatic way to track companies. We're copying the best practices from CRM systems, and bringing our data model to the next level.

## **What's new**

Start sending events to June, and we'll automatically create companies for you. We'll also automatically link users to companies, so you can see which companies are using your product.

This solves a few problems:

- Setup - You don't need to set up companies anymore, we'll do it for you. You'll still be able to create custom types of groups of users, but you won't need to do it to track companies.
- Impersonation - If you have admin users, your own team members will not be counted as users of those companies.
- Multiple environments - You now don't need to track multiple environments (e.g. staging, test, production) for the same company.
- Enrichment - We'll enable you to automatically enrich companies with public data, such as their logo, employee count, and even their estimated revenue.

All of this will take at least couple of weeks to be released, but we think it's worth it to make this big change now rather than later. We can't wait to see how it will make your life easier.

**Other improvements**

- We improved the reliability of our Mixpanel data importer - in certain edge cases, we were not able to complete imports with a large number of events. We've fixed that.
- We polished some issues that came up after releasing our new onboarding flow.
- We improved the reliability of our Hubspot data sync. We're now able to sync more data, more quickly.
- We polished the navigation bar in the reports to work better on smaller screens.
- We've been focused on fixing any critical bugs that you've reported as quickly as possible.
