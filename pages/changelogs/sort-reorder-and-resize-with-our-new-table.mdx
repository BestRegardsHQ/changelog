In your day to day many of you rely on our people list to look up your customers and understand how they're using your product.

This week we've taken a huge step forward in terms of helping you customise the experience of what you're able to see at a glance.


The first update we pushed is a new redesign that makes it easier for us to show more information on the screen about your users.

Additionally the columns can now be reordered by either dragging, or opening the menu.

Lastly columns with computed traits now support sorting - so you can create lists for things like the companies with the most active seats or the users at churn risk.

We can't wait to see how you use this.


**Other improvements**

- Speed up how we process batches of records for Hubspot CRM syncs of over 100.000 users - data syncing should now take maximum up to a few hours depending on your plan limits for Hubspot API usage
- Fix error when sharing insights publicly for the most active users
