After two months of work and a lot of iterations we're finally ready to release the beta version of our auto-generated companies.

This feature will automatically create a company for each of your users and group them together based on their email domain.

The newly generated companies work seamlessly with the rest of the product.

You can now use them everywhere:

- In reports
- In audiences
- In views
- In computed traits
- In the Hubspot & Attio integrations

## How to enable companies

Reach out to us in the chat and we'll enable it for you. Once enabled, you'll see a new "Companies" object in the settings.

This is still a beta feature, so please let us know if you find any rough edges. We'll be ironing them out in the next few weeks before we release it to everyone.

**Other improvements**

- Pushed a new collapsed sidebar design and polished the sidebar in general
- Fixed how the report level toggle shows up on the latest Chrome version
- Fixed an issue where traits weren't loading in the Hubspot app
- Prevent deletions to start for empty user_id or group_id
- Align all the gray-scale colors in the app to use the same palette
- Fix plan shown as "Free_Plan" instead of "Free Plan" in sidebar
