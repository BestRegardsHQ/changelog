Holy guacamole, form fans! We've been busy bees 🐝 in the hive of innovation, and boy oh boy, do we have some sweet updates for you! Buckle up, because your forms are about to get a makeover that would make even Cinderella's Fairy Godmother jealous.

### Responsive Inline Forms: Because Size Does Matter! 📱💻

Remember when your inline forms looked like they'd been squished by a digital steamroller on mobile devices? Well, no more! We've given our forms a crash course in yoga, and now they're more flexible than a gymnast doing the splits.

On desktop, your forms will stand tall and proud, showing off all their fields in a majestic display of data collection.

But on mobile? They'll do the limbo, baby! Sleek, compact, and ready to rock on even the tiniest screens. It's like having a form that moonlights as a transformer – more than meets the eye!

### Multiple Form Embeddings: Because Sometimes, Once is Not Enough! 🔄

We heard you loud and clear when you said, "Hey, I want to use this awesome form more than once on my page!" And we thought, "Why not? The more, the merrier!"

So we fixed that pesky bug faster than you can say "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." Now you can embed the same form multiple times on a single page. It's like form inception, but without the confusing plot twists!

Go ahead, sprinkle those forms like confetti across your page. Your users will thank you for the convenience, and your data will be doing the conga line into your database!

### The Great Form Switcheroo: Full-Page to Inline in a Blink! 👁️‍🗨️

Ever wished you could switch between full-page and inline forms faster than a chameleon changes colors? Well, wish no more! We've added a magical button that lets you flip between form views quicker than you can say "abracadabra"!

One second, you're looking at a form that's living its best life, taking up the whole page like it's at a form spa...

And bam! With just one click, it's now an inline form, rubbing shoulders with your other content like they're best buds at a block party.

It's so easy, you might find yourself switching back and forth just for fun. (We won't judge. We do it too sometimes. It's oddly satisfying!)

But here's the important part: **don't forget to click that "Update" or "Save" button after making your changes!** This ensures that your new form layout will be reflected in your live and embedded forms. It's like the final "ta-da!" in your form transformation magic show!

### But Wait, There's More! 🎁

- We've taught our forms to speak emoji. Okay, not really, but wouldn't that be cool? 😎
- We're working on optimizing form loading speeds. Stay tuned for future updates on performance improvements!
- We've added a secret "dark mode" for vampires filling out forms. Just kidding, but now we kind of want to do that...

Happy form-ing, everyone!
