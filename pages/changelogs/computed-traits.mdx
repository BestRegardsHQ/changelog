One of our most requested features is the ability to create traits that are computed from events.

For instance being able to have a trait like "Reports opened in the last 7 days" or "Number of times a user has logged in".

We're finally releasing this today!

## How it works

We built a no-code interface that allows you to create traits that are computed from events. It works similarly to how you would setup a report, but instead of showing you a report, it creates a trait.
