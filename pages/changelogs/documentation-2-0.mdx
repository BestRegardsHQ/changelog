A lot of our users have been frustrated with the conciseness of our documentation. When starting out with our documentation we tried to keep everything as short as possible, but we've come to realize that this has made it hard for new users to get started with our SDKs.

As much as having less text to read is nice, it's not very helpful if you don't know what the text means.

So last week we decided to make some changes, both to our documentation and to some of our SDKs.

We've added a lot of new more in-depth content to our docs, and we've also made it easier to find the information you need.

Additionally, we've documented more thoroughly how our HTTP API works, so that we don't keep you guessing about what are the parameters you can pass.

One of the challenges here is that having more documentation can lead to the feeling that getting started with our SDKs is more complicated than it actually is.

As part of this work, we've also wrote a short guide with some tips on how to get started with our SDKs. Our [what should I track](https://www.june.so/docs/plan) guide aims to help people get started without overthinking things.

## Node SDK with typings

We've added typings to our Node SDK, so you can now get code completion in your IDE and so that you can see the types of the parameters you need to pass to our methods.

This should make it easier to use our SDK in projects that use TypeScript. You can find the new version of our NPM package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@june-so/analytics-node).

## Debugger

As part of the work to make it easier to get started with our SDKs, we've also built a debugger. With our debugger you can see all the data that's being sent to June. This should make it a lot easier to understand and debug your tracking code.

You can find the debugger in the onboarding section of the app or by visiting this [link](https://analytics.june.so/redirect-to-my-workspace/debugger).

## Other improvements

We're working on performance and stability improvements across the product. So as part of this week we finished rolling out our new chart caching system. This should make our charts load faster when you're opening the app.

We updated the design of our bottom action bar, so that it's easier to discover.

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
