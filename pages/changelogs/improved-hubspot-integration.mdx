We're getting more and more exciting feedback for our Hubspot integration and this week we released an exciting update to it.

You can now map your June companies and your Hubspot companies by their unique id. This means that if you have a custom set up for Hubspot that uses the same identifier you use in your database for your companies and users, you can now map them to your June data.

On top of this we rolled out some stability improvements into how we sync the data between June and Hubspot. This means that you should see your June data appear in Hubspot faster and more reliably.

**Other improvements**

- Lots of bug fixes and product improvements in our onboarding journey. We went through our onboarding as a team and we fixed a lot of the issues we found.
