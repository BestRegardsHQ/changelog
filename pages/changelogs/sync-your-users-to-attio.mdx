After a lot of requests, syncing Users into Attio is finally available.

In the past couple of years one big lesson we learned is how much more useful product usage data gets when you get a full picture of your customers.

With the new Attio User Sync, you can now have a unified view of who your sales and success people are talking to and how they're using your product.

For any company that treats inbound seriously this is a must have. Without something like this you're missing out on opportunities to grow your revenue.

**Other improvements**

- We increased the number of insights in a view from 12 to 15
- Improve the audience trait filter editor UI to be more on brand
- Don't capitalise emails in the User profile bradcrumbs
- Improve stability of our retention cohort table, in the past results would intermittently get stuck in a loading state
