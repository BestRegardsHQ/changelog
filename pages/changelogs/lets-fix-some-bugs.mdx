This week we focused on fixing bugs and improving the overall experience of June.

The main areas of improvement are:

- We redesigned and improved the rough edges of the Hubspot and Attio integrations to make them more intuitive and reliable.
- We improved the design and experience of using the June CMD-K shortcut to quickly navigate to any page in June.
