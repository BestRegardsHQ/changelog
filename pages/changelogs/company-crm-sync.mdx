We just released support for syncing June companies to Hubspot and Attio.

To enable this head to *Settings > Integrations > Hubspot*.

With this release the new auto-generated companies support the same features as the companies created using the [group call](https://www.june.so/docs/tracking/http-api/group).

Aside from that we've worked on improvements to our CRM sync reliability.
