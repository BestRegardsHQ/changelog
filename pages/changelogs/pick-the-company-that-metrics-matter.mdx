Many of our users spend most of their time using June looking at how individual companies are using their product. Last week after many requests we introduced the same level of flexibility we offer on the Views to all company pages.

## Customise company pages

You can now pick the metrics that matter from the reports you care about and have them show up on every company page. This allows you to have a customised overview of how a company is using your product.

![](https://june-changelog.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/pick-the-company-that-metrics-matter/b2b-profile-editing-experience.png)

Some of the most useful metrics we've been seeing are:

- An overview of activation
- Weekly usage of the key features that drive retention
- Most active users in the company in the last 90 days
- Users at risk of churning

Let us know what metrics you find most useful!

## Other improvements

- We pushed more performance improvements to the June app specifically on the active users and feature report. We're spending a lot of time monitoring performance and every time we see something that loads slowly for you we try and make it faster. If you notice something that's important to you and that is slow, please let us know!
- We built a new system to delete data from our analytics database that batches the deletion of data and makes it much faster. This allows us to process all event and user deletions within 48 hours instead of 10 days.
- We pushed a fix to the events feed on the events page that in some cases was not showing the full list of events.
- We redesigned how events and pageviews look on a single user page to make it easier to read and understand.
- We fixed a bug where Export CSV was not taking into account audience rules for saved audiences

export default ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <MdxLayout meta={meta} {...rest}>
    {children}
  </MdxLayout>
);
