This week we're super proud to share with you our new insights on the Retention report.

**These insights are the fastest way to identify the customer you should be talking to!**

We really believe that the key to building a better product is understanding your users.

Traditionally analytics products have been focused on providing you the most advanced possible tools to answer any question you might have.

Today though, the problem most companies face is being disconnected from their customers.

This week we added two powerful insights to the retention report. We hope they'll inspire you and your colleagues to build amazing connections with your customers - both the highly satisfied and the ones leaving you.

Just open up the retention report, look at your best and churning users and start 3 conversations with them âœ¨

**Other improvements**

- We added a 5y timerange option to the active users report
- We added event counts to the active users insights
- We added an event count change computed trait to all workspaces
- We updated the default interval type on the user profile to be weekly
- We added workspace switcher on our paywall - so you don't get stuck if one of your workspaces gets paywalled
