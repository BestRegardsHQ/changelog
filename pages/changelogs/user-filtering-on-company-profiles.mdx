This week the most important thing we've shipped is our users table within company profiles.

In the past months we've noticed how heavily people rely on company profiles and have been making progress towards giving you more power and flexibility in the way that you assess customer health.

One thing we know is that many of you really love our people list table.

So this week we've extended it to work also on company profiles.

This means that if you have a massive Fortune 100 customer that has a ton of seats and that you really care about, you can now treat is as its own audience and have a fast overview of who are the people using your product.

On top of that we now also support CSV exports in the company page, so you can export and present your data to your customers when it's time for renewals ğŸ’°

In the coming weeks you can expect improvements to all of our tables - we want to make sure you're able to get all the information you need in the most efficient way possible.


**Other improvements**

- Improved how the feed page shows up on larger screens
- Fixed a bug in reports that was causing infinite loading issues
- We built better monitoring and errors when CRM syncs fail
- We added "active days" as a new computed trait type, so you can have a customisable count of how many days a user or company has been active using your product
- We added a search for traits in the people list table
