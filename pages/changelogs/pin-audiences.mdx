We're bringing audiences to the center of the product experience.

For a long time we've focused our product and energies on making our reports better and better every week.

But one underrated area of the product that didn't receive enough love are our audiences.

In the past month we've pushed some major updates to audiences that make them a lot more useful, from being able to pin columns, edit their setup quickly and more.

We felt that it was time to bring audiences front and center to the product experience and for this reason we're now displaying audiences for quick access in the main product sidebar.

This feature was first introduced in an internal build to see whether it felt right or not, and since then we've been using it extensively.

We can't wait to see how you make use of them.


**Other improvements**

- Show a preview of the mappings for Attio syncs in the CRM settings
- The size of columns in the People list is now persisted
- We made retries of Mixpanel imports self-serve, so you don't need to reach out to us if they fail
