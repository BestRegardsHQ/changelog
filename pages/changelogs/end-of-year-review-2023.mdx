For the last changelog of the year we wanted to do a round-up of what we've built this year and give you a glimpse of what the future holds for us.

We want to build more than just product analytics, we think that we need new ways to connect teams with their products.

All of the work we do is building towards this vision we have - and the further we get the more we realise how exciting this opportunity is.

But before talking about this past year, we need to share a bit of context around where we were last year today.

At the start of the year we had two key insights:

- **Product analytics tools weren't made for B2B.** When your product's users are companies the way you should be using analytics data in your companies' day to day is fundamentally different
- **Simple things should be easy, complex things should be possible.** If we can do something for you with no setup we should do it for you. Customising the default settings after that should be possible. Existing tools sacrifice too much simplicity for customisation.

From these insights in the we've built a ton of exciting things!

## Product analytics tools weren't made for B2B

Every SaaS company has a CRM. For some reason it was extremely hard to have your product data in your CRM.

This year we changed this, but to get this right, we had to rethink the whole journey of using June.

**Step One - Getting a good data setup.**

From our new onboarding ([released in October](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/developer-tools)), to our developer tools ([released in November](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/developer-tools)), our new documentation, to automatically generating companies your users belong to ([released in December](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/releasing-objects)).

This year we made a huge leap forward in terms of making it easier to get started with June.

**Step Two - Create as much value as possible using this data.**

The new company pages allow you to get with zero effort reports on each of your customers ([released in Feburary](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/company-reports)).

On top of that we built smart-traits that allow you to calculate things like "Active seats in the last 14 days" to make more in-depth analysis ([released in September](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/computed-traits)).

To make these profiles the fastest way to know how a customer is using your product, we built a super-fast CMD-K search ([released in September](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/speed)).

**Step Three - Bring these insights to your CRMs**

We released our Attio integration ([released in September](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/attio)) and introduced a ton of customisation to be able to map and sync data from June to your CRM.

### **What's next?**

Over the next year we think there's so much more we can do here. From automatically giving you traits like "Company size" to using AI to analyse how each of your customers is using your product.

## Simple things should be easy, complex things should be possible

At the [start of the year](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/make-features-people-want) we released the Feature report, which has become the most popular report in June by far!

From there we've made some big improvements in terms of flexibility. We now support combining AND/OR rules in audiences ([released in June](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/combine-and-or)). You can now also create multiple views and customise the cards on your home ([released in March](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/edit-home)).

Additionally our analysis capabilities got much more powerful.

Our funnel became much more flexible ([released in March](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/funnel-multiple-events)).

We also introduced AI insights on top of a SQL editor, so that our power users aren't limited by the reports we've built ([released in June](https://changelog.june.so/changelogs/conversational-ai-and-new-dock))

### **What's next?**

Over the next year we want to make the experience of creating and editing reports much faster, customisable and delightful.

We already started making some prototypes in this area, and have found some interesting directions to make things much easier to understand.

## Stepping in to 2024

In the next year as we've managed to grow quite substantially, expect us making bigger and bigger investments into building a better service and product.

We're extremely excited about what's coming next and can't wait to share more of our journey with you.

As always feel free to reach out to us and send feedback. We're happy to help you answer any product related question you have!
