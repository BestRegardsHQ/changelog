Our Hubspot app settings just got much better!

You can now manage the settings of how each of your June objects gets synced to Hubspot.

This means that you can enable User creation in Hubspot, but you can skip creating any companies that aren't present.

On top of this we pushed a lot of quality of life improvements to our Hubspot integration that should make it easier to understand and set things up.

We're really happy of how much progress we've made with our CRM integrations and are getting closer to ironing out all the most common edge cases that come from integrating with them!


**Other improvements**

- Company and workspace page loading state polish
- Enable workspaces by default for new apps
- Fix a UI bug on live company card in the feature report
- Disable manual HubSpot creation of users when the email is missing
- Improved reliability on app and company deletions
